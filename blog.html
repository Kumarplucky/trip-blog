          <h3>Hi, I am kumar priti sanjiban. A student of B.J.B Autonomous college pursuing my postgraduate(P.G) from the branch of master in science in electronics and telecommunications.
             After completion of the semester examinations, all of our batchmates planned a trip to an unknown and never visited the place as it was winter season everyone came forward to join us on the trip, and being a bike riding lovers we all decided to travel in our bikes and then after a lot of research and planning we all decided a place to visit that is ''SALIA DAM''. which is in khordha district and approximatively 100kms from Bhubaneswar (capital city of Odisha). so, a date has been decided was 26 December 2021 and finally, the day came we all around 22 friends with more than 10 bikes started the trip in early winter morning the weather was chilly but we all boost up with excitement for the trip and the bike ride was fun in between the trip we all took a break for the breakfast and also for the photographs, then after 1 and half hours of the ride we reached banapur town around 9 AM than from the locals we came to know that nearby there was a waterfall which was named as ''JHIRPADA WATERFALL'' after listening about the waterfall from locals we all get excited to visit that place then after getting the direction from the locals we all went to jhiripada waterfall from this the title came 'a planned trip to an unplanned destination'. when we reached that place the waterfall was small but the beauty of the nature make us look at that waterfall for a long time then our friends started jumping into the waters and started taking bath in it, we all enjoyed it for a long time then we moved towards our planned destination that was salia dam, it took us around 30 to 40 minutes to reach salia dam and the natural beauty of the dam was extremely beautiful and astonishing then after spending some time in the nature and dam took photographs of that place that you will be watching below after exploring the place for while we have arranged lunch and then having beautiful lunch or you can say it as a feast then after enjoying ourselves the day came to an end we all started our returning journey towards Bhubaneswar. At the end of the day, the trip to salia dam and jhiripada waterfall was a memorable day that will be remembered by all of our friends forever.
             You can also visit this hidden secret place of Odisha which is easy to access and you can reach there by using Google Maps.
